# System Design Learnings

This repository is a living log of my journey learning **system design from first principles**.

I’m not treating system design as a checklist of buzzwords or interview answers.  
The goal here is to **understand why systems are designed the way they are**, by building, breaking, measuring, and validating ideas with code.

## Motivation

I realized early that:
- Reading blogs ≠ understanding systems  
- Memorizing patterns ≠ being able to design them  
- Diagrams without experiments ≈ hand-waving  

So instead of passively consuming content, I decided to:
- Implement core system design concepts myself
- Measure their behavior under realistic scenarios
- Compare naïve approaches with production-grade ones
- Document what actually works, what breaks, and why

This repository exists to make that learning **explicit and concrete**.

## What You’ll Find Here

Each folder in this repository focuses on **one system design concept**, explored through:
- A clean implementation (usually from scratch)
- Experiments to validate guarantees and trade-offs
- Notes on why the design exists and where it fails

---

## Learning Philosophy

- Code over theory
- Measurements over claims
- Simplicity over cleverness
- Understanding trade-offs over chasing “best practices”

If a concept claims to provide guarantees, I try to **verify them empirically**.
If a naïve approach fails, I want to see **how badly it fails**.

## Why This Is Public

This repo is public for two reasons:
1. To keep myself accountable and consistent
2. To document my thinking clearly enough that someone else could follow it

If someone else finds it useful, that’s a bonus — but the primary goal is **depth of understanding**, not polish.

## Status

Active and evolving.  
New topics will be added as I study and implement them.
